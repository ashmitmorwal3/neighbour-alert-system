Neighbour Alert System
A real-time web application designed to enhance community communication by allowing users to send location-based alerts and messages to nearby neighbors

Enables users to send alerts like "Emergency" or "Pet Lost" to neighbors within their area using WebSocket-based communication.

Displays the sender's location on an interactive map, powered by Leaflet.js, ensuring neighbors can identify the origin of alerts.

Allows users to send personalized messages with their live location, providing flexibility in communication.

Only displays the senderâ€™s location on the map, ensuring user privacy and relevance of shared information
